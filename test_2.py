# Design an algorithm that takes in an integer
# that represents the lenght (defined as: n) of a string. 
# The string should print out n times numbers in a sequence.
# The following sequence starts:; 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37,...

n = int(input("Enter the length of the sequence: ")) # Do not change this line
